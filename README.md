# Bookshelf

A smart way to manage your reading lists.

Organize and tag your lists in any way you want, and filter by tags, along with read, unread, or both. Add book images or article thumbnails for easy access, and tag your content individually!

Built with React, Redux, Styled Components, and TypeScript.
